# Project JUno
This is my version of JUno, the project for the "Metodologie di Programmazione" course (programming methodology) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.studiareinformatica.uniroma1.it/).  
In order to run it, download the .jar file from the releases section. If you want to build it yourself, you just need JDK/OpenJDK as it's made with Java Swing (I know, I know...).  
Most of the assets are from Wikimedia Commons, the rest I made them myself (do what you want with them).  
Javadocs were generated with Eclipse.
